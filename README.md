# Code Samples
This repository contains some samples of codes written by me (Fan Bu). Below is a list of categories and corresponding file names for your reference.

## iOS App Sample Code (Swift)
This folder contains the sample code of "Fitness Diary", an iOS app I wrote in Swift with 3D functionalities. The app helps users track their workouts and statistics, and shows a 3D avatar that resembles the user's current physique. Frameworks such as UIKit, SceneKit and Core Data were used. This app is already off App Store, as I did not continue to subscribe to Apple's Developer Program. Some snapshots of the app is included in the folder. For more information, check out the comments at the top of the source code file.

## Coursework Sample Code (C, Standard ML, Python, System Verilog)
The following files/folders are samples of codes that I wrote for course homework, projects, etc. at Carnegie Mellon University.
- **proxy_lab.c** (a concurrent proxy that can process HTTP requests and cache recent requested web objects)
- **parallel_BFS.sml** (both sequential and parallel implementation of Breadth-First Search using a functional programming language)
- **RSA_decryption.py** (a demonstration of decryption under the RSA scheme in Python)
- **Game Pong in System Verilog** (a hardware thread project written in System Verilog that implements the Game "Pong" on FPGA boards)

## Competitive Programming Sample Code (C/C++)
This folder contains a competitive programming question and my solution. I wrote it when I was practicing competitive programming on an online judge platform.

## "Codes I wrote for fun" Sample (C)
The file **huffman_coding.c** is a sample of codes that I wrote in my free time for fun. Sometimes when I learn an interesting algorithm or CS problem online, I like to implement it and write it down, and make sure it runs as expected.
